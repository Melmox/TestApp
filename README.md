# TestApp
It`s a test task app which represents data from API of NYT. 

# Control
Swipe to right side allows to add or remove article from favorite
Four tabs allows to change what type of articles user want to see

# What used
First of all I used Cocoapods to manage pods which was used in project. I used "Alamofire" to do the API requests and "Fuzi" 
whith which I tried to store html page of article as .webarchive file but unfortunately I didn`t deal with this problem
As well I used CoreData to store small part of info which I resived via API. Also in project I used a bit of NotificationCenter class Finaly I tried to use the pattern MVVM and some SOLID statements.
